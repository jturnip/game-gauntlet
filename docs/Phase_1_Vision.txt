Game Gauntlet – Phase 1: Vision Document
--------------------------------------------------

1. Purpose
-----------
The Game Gauntlet is a platform designed to make game nights and tournaments more fun, cohesive, and competitive.
It acts as the connective tissue between a variety of games — turning a series of otherwise unrelated games into a single, unified experience.

The Game Gauntlet provides structure, progression, and excitement by layering themes, achievements, powerups, and point systems over any type of game — whether video games, board games, or physical activities.

Core Idea:
"The Game Gauntlet turns a night of random games into an epic multi-game tournament experience."

--------------------------------------------------

2. Target Users
----------------
Players:
- Participate in games outside the app (board games, video games, etc.)
- View available achievements, powerups, and leaderboards
- Spin interactive wheels when prompted during gameplay
- Use or purchase powerups during certain phases
- Eventually view a live event screen or join online events

Admins:
- Create and manage Gauntlets (events)
- Choose themes, games, point values, achievements, powerups, and wheel options
- Run games, input results, and monitor logs
- Manage rounds and player states throughout the event
- In the future, collaborate with other admins or co-hosts
- Manage automation for achievements and powerup usage where possible

--------------------------------------------------

3. Core Value
--------------
The Game Gauntlet is a new way to do a game night — adding structure, drama, and strategy to group gaming.

It appeals to:
- Groups of friends who love playing competitive games together
- Gamers who enjoy systems, rewards, and leaderboards
- Event hosts who want to make game nights exciting and replayable

The app makes each event unique with customizable elements like themes, powerups, and wheels — ensuring no two Gauntlets are ever the same.

Tagline-level summary:
"Compete across games. Earn achievements. Spin the wheels of fate. Become the champion of the Gauntlet."

--------------------------------------------------

4. Core Event Flow
-------------------
1. Setup Phase (Admin):
   - Admin schedules the event and creates a new Gauntlet.
   - Players are invited and registered.
   - Admin selects the theme, games, point structure, achievements, powerups, and wheel outcomes.

2. Event Start:
   - Admin introduces the Gauntlet and kicks off the first round.
   - Players play the first game externally (e.g., Mario Kart, Codenames, etc.).

3. Scoring Phase:
   - Admin inputs placements or scores into the app.
   - Points are automatically distributed based on the setup.

4. Wheel Phase:
   - A player is chosen to spin a wheel that determines a mini-game, challenge, or bonus.
   - Winners or losers spin blessed or cursed wheels accordingly.

5. Powerup & Shop Phase:
   - Players can use powerups or buy new ones from the in-app store using points.

6. Next Round Begins:
   - Repeat until all scheduled games are complete.

7. End Phase:
   - App calculates totals and declares the overall Gauntlet Champion.
   - Optional post-event results or recap screens can be shown.

--------------------------------------------------

5. Long-Term Vision (SaaS Future)
----------------------------------
The ultimate goal is to turn the Game Gauntlet into a SaaS platform where anyone can host their own Gauntlets.

Public Version Goals:
- Admins purchase a subscription or license to host Gauntlets.
- Each admin’s data (themes, games, scores, etc.) is isolated from others (multi-tenancy).
- Admins can create templates or share their setups publicly.
- Players can join events for free by invitation link or code.
- Future versions may support:
  - Online play with live event screens
  - Multiple admins per Gauntlet
  - Automated scoring integrations
  - Community achievements and powerup markets

Core SaaS Vision:
"A platform for friends, communities, and creators to build and run their own Game Gauntlets — customized tournaments that turn any collection of games into a unified, story-driven experience."
